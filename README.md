JavaScript Template Language Transformations (JTLT, pronounced as "Jetlet")

Uses an approach similar to [XSLT](http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/) for
declarative, linear declaration of templates, but with JSON or JavaScript
object data sources. As with XSLT, can be transformed into different
formats (e.g., HTML strings, JSON, DOM objects, etc.).
